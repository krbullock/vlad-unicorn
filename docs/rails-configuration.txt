= Configuring Unicorn for Rails

== Setting the environment

As of 2.3.0, vlad-unicorn allows you to pass the Rails or Rack environment to
the +unicorn+ command (the +--env+ option):

    set :unicorn_env, 'production'

This can also be done by setting the appropriate environment variable in the
unicorn.rb config file, like so:

    ENV['RAILS_ENV'] = 'production'
    ENV['RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT'] = '/prefix'

== Using with Bundler

When deploying with Bundler, it's often more robust to <code>bundle exec</code>
everything. This can be done by setting +unicorn_use_bundler+ to true in your
deploy.rb. By default, this will change into the current release directory and
run +bundle exec+ there.

This can be changed by setting +unicorn_bundle_cmd+. One alternate approach is
to pass the full Gemfile path using the BUNDLE_GEMFILE environment variable:

    set :unicorn_bundle_cmd, "BUNDLE_GEMFILE=#{current_path}/Gemfile bundle exec"
