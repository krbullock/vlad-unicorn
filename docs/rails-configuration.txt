= Configuring Unicorn for Rails

== Setting environment and prefix

The astute observer will notice the lack of variables in vlad-unicorn to set
the Rails environment or a path prefix for the app (the +unicorn_rails+
command allows this with with the +--env+ and +--path+ options, respectively).
Both of these can just as easily be done by setting the appropriate
environment variables in the unicorn.rb config file, like so:

    ENV['RAILS_ENV'] = 'production'
    ENV['RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT'] = '/prefix'

== Using with Rails 2.3 and Bundler

When using Rails 2.3 with Bundler, you have to <code>bundle exec</code>
everything. This can be done by setting +unicorn_command+ in your deploy.rb.
Since Vlad doesn't change into the +RAILS_ROOT+ directory before attempting to
run remote commands, though, you have to explicitly tell Bundler where the
Gemfile is:

    set :unicorn_command, "bundle --gemfile=#{current_path}/Gemfile exec unicorn_rails"
